### Step-by-Step Plan

### Optimized Step-by-Step Plan

#### Step 1: Object-Oriented Programming and Design Patterns 
- **Define Classes for Core Components**:
  - **Grid**: Represents the computational grid, boundary conditions, and source term.
  - **Solver**: Encapsulates iterative or direct solvers, like Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, or Conjugate Gradient.
    - Direct methods:
        - Nested dissection, O(n³)
        - Fast Poisson Solvers, O(n² log n)

    - Iterative methods:
        - Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel relaxation, O(n⁴)
        - SOR (successive over-relaxation), O(n³)
        - Krylov methods, Conjugate Gradients, O(n³)
        - Multigrid methods, O(n²)
  - **Preconditioner**: Implements optional preconditioning methods.
- **Implement Design Patterns**:
  - **Strategy Pattern**: Swap different solvers dynamically without changing the core algorithm.
  - **Factory Pattern**: Create different types of grids or boundary condition classes based on input parameters.
- **Encapsulation and Inheritance**: Organize code and promote reusability.

#### Step 2: Functional Programming 

#### Step 3: Implement Core Solvers with Preconditioners
- **Implement Iterative Methods**:
  - Use methods like Conjugate Gradient or GMRES.
- **Implement Preconditioners**:
  - Introduce preconditioning methods to accelerate convergence.

#### Step 4: Sparse Matrix Representation
- **Implement Sparse Matrix Data Structures**

#### Step 5: Unit Testing and Optimization
- **Write Unit Tests**:

`python -m unittest discover -s test`.


#### Step 6: Caching and Decomposition 
- **Implement Caching**:
  - Use memoization or caching techniques to speed up computations.
- **Problem Decomposition**:
  - Break down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.

#### Step 7: Graph-Based Approaches 
- **Graph representation**: Implement graph-based representations for the problem.
- **Graph algorithms**: Use algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* for optimization.

#### Step 8: Parallelization
- **Graph representation**: Implement graph-based representations for the problem.
- **Graph algorithms**: Use algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* for optimization.

### Future Plan (Tasks to be deferred)
- **Parallelization and CUDA**: Use Multithreading and Multiprocessing for parallel processing and GPU acceleration using CUDA.
- **Advanced optimizations**: Further optimize algorithms and data structures for performance.
- **Adaptive Methods, and Time-Stepping**: Implement these advanced techniques for further optimization.
- **Neural network**: Use Neural network to solve PDE.
- **Integrate with C++**: Optimize the speed of Python by integrating with C++.
- **Documentation and tutorials**: Create comprehensive documentation and tutorials for future reference.
